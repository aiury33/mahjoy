# mahjoy
 
 Hi! This is a project that I created from scratch in a couple of hours to test my Xbox controllers!

 Enjoy mahjoy! Myyy joystick application. Hehe.
 
 mahjoy allows you to:

	1. Visualize real-time input from your Xbox controller.
	2. See button presses, joystick movements, and trigger pulls directly on your screen.
	3. Test the functionality and responsiveness of your Xbox controllers.
	4. Enjoy a user-friendly interface for an engaging interaction with your controller.
